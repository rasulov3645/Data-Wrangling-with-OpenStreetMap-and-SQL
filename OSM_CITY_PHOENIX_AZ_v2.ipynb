The benefit of such a recommendation system is straightforward - having an idea of places worthy to go / or even live. Implementing a system like this would have one major downside - the recommendations would be highly subjective in regard to the user adding the information and could also be outdated quickly if not updated regurlarly. \n",

One way to display this could be a heatmap showing how a region has been updated (frequency / time). The benefit for the community would be to quickly see which regions to focus on for maximum benefit of overall map quality."
